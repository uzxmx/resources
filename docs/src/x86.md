## Real mode

Less than 1 MB of RAM is available for use.
There is no hardware-based memory protection (GDT), nor virtual memory.
There is no built in security mechanisms to protect against buggy or malicious applications.
The default CPU operand length is only 16 bits.
The memory addressing modes provided are more restrictive than other CPU modes.
Accessing more than 64k requires the use of segment register that are difficult to work with.
